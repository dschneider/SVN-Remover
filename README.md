# SVN Remover #

## Usage ##

Just open a terminal and point to the SVN Remover python script (in this case it's in the current directory). The first parameter must be the path which should be cleaned of all the SVN folders:

    python removesvn.py /path/to/folder/where/svn/should/be/removed

You are then able to see all the SVN folders that are being removed.
